# CISS2020-Spectrum-Sensing-Deep-Learning
Spectrum Sensing in Interference and Noise Using Deep Learning, 2020 54th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)

These scripts will:
1) create images to be used with the signal detector
2) train the signal detector
3) test the signal detector

This was written in Matlab.  This will require the Deep Learning toolbox.
